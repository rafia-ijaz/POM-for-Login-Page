The Page Object Model provides the following key benefits for test automation in Cypress:

Readability: Tests are clean and readable.
Maintainability: Easy to update selectors in one place.
Reusability: Reuse common actions across tests.
Reduced Duplication: Keeps code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
Scalability: Manages growth in tests effectively.
In essence, POM enhances the organization, maintainability, and scalability of test automation code, which is especially valuable in large projects or projects that undergo frequent changes.
